This is VERY much in Alpha - there is a config.ini file that will need to be set up. In the "lightstochange" portion put every light you want to change to red followed by a comma. In the "ip" field you need to put the IP address of your Hue bridge. Go to your app, go to `Settings -> Hue Bridges -> i -> IP address` to find yours.

Brandon is doing some work to make this compatible for Windows. I'll go through and make some comments today so it's more readable.
